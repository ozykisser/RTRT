Title: Introduction to Regulated Trinary Reduction Theory (RTRT)

Keywords: physics, cosmology, unified theory, geometry of energy and time, RTRT, MREP, fine-structure constant, dark matter, gravity, time cascade

Summary / Abstract

From 1905 to 2025, it’s a straight 110-year arc of physics that this work finally closes.

Einstein opened the door by relating energy and time.
Planck quantized it.
Dirac formalized it.
Higgs added the curvature of mass.
RTRT completes the sequence — sealing the geometry between them and showing that energy and time are the structure itself, not what flows through it.

RTRT doesn’t rewrite history — it completes it.
It stands as the natural descendant of the 1905 relativity papers, the 1928 Dirac equation, and the 2012 Higgs discovery — all converging into a single principle: the regulated cascade of time.

And, God forbid — RTRT finally marries quantum mechanics and general relativity without inventing “quantum gravity.”
In this framework, gravity is not quantized; it is time’s one-way cascade, the simplest geometric truth hiding in plain sight.
