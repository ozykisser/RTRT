## Overview
**Regulated Trinary Reduction Theory (RTRT)** is a geometric framework uniting energy, entropy, and time as a single regulated cascade.  
It reformulates the foundations of physics to show that geometry itself arises from the interaction between **energy density** and **temporal flow**,  
with entropy acting as the mediating degree of freedom.

RTRT reproduces key constants—\( c \), \( G \), \( \alpha \), and the ΛCDM cosmological parameters—without invoking fields or hidden variables.  
It provides a fully deterministic structure linking relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

## Publication Summary
From 1905 to 2025, it’s a straight 110-year arc of physics now closed.

- **Einstein** opened the door by relating energy and time.  
- **Planck** quantized it.  
- **Dirac** formalized it.  
- **Higgs** added the curvature of mass.  
- **Garret R. J. Krampe** sealed the geometry between them — showing that energy and time *are the structure*, not what flows through it.

RTRT doesn’t rewrite history — it completes it.  
It stands as the natural descendant of the 1905 papers, the 1928 Dirac equation, and the 2012 Higgs discovery —  
converging into the **regulated cascade of time**.
